### What the heck is that?
Yeah, I can explain each instance's purpose, but you can figure it out :)
Long Story Short is 
- Bastion is the only instance should have access to the internet and open port 22
- Transfer station is only responsible for Downloading the sample and sending it Dynamic and static instances.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform
- AWS CLI, AWS IAM user
- S3 bucket for Terraform state

### Pre Deploy
1. Clone the repository "yaah"
2. Configure AWS credentials
3. Create the Terraform state bucket
```
aws configure
aws s3 api create-bucket --bucket {nameofyourbucket} --region {Choose AWS Region}
```
### Deployment
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Cleanup

```
terraform apply -destroy
```
